# Project TODO List

This document outlines potential improvements for the project based on the current state and core functionality.

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Integration of Asset Creation and Minting
- Currently, there are separate workflows for creating assets and minting NFTs
- We could create a unified workflow where:
  - Users create asset documentation
  - Preview the generated document
  - Mint it as an NFT in a single flow
  - Add a "Create and Mint" button that handles the entire process

### 2. Enhanced Document Templates
- Add more document templates beyond the current options
- Allow users to save and reuse custom templates
- Implement a preview gallery of template options
- Add the ability to import custom backgrounds or logos

### 3. Improved Whitelist Management
- Create a more user-friendly whitelist request system
- Add admin dashboard for whitelist management
- Implement batch operations for whitelist addresses
- Add email notifications for whitelist status changes

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness
- Optimize the document creation interface for mobile devices
- Make the minting process mobile-friendly
- Ensure the generated documents look good on all screen sizes

### 5. User Dashboard
- Create a personalized dashboard showing:
  - User's minted NFTs
  - Pending transactions
  - Whitelist status
  - Recent activity

### 6. Batch Operations
- Allow users to mint multiple NFTs in a single transaction
- Implement batch document generation
- Add bulk upload for whitelist addresses

### 7. Enhanced Metadata
- Add more metadata fields for better asset documentation
- Support for different asset types with specialized fields
- Include verification mechanisms for asset authenticity

### 8. Security Enhancements
- Implement multi-signature requirements for high-value assets
- Add time-locks for certain operations
- Improve contract security with additional checks
